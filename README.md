# Digitalization-Of-Historical-Artefacts-Using-WordPress

This was a joint project with Hochschule Neu-Ulm(HNU) Applied Sciences, Germany. 

We were tasked with digitalising historical artefacts from the University of Western Cape (UWC) Robben Island Mayibuye Archives.

My team was responsible for digitalising historical papers, and created a website via WordPress to display the artefacts and present a template that might be used for the archive's official website in future. 

On WordPress, the Elementor plugin was used for its re-active elements and because it was easier to design and edit the website due to its drag-and-drop function.
